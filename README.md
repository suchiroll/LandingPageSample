# LandingPageSample

I took a few liberties with the design, to accomodate for a few bits of info I didn't have or to make the design more cohesive. 

Changes:
I didn't have the eye icon for show password, so I replaced it with an X. 
I settled on a yellow tone for the highlight cover, which can be viewed on hover for links, in the menu, and for the sign up button.
I chose a different image because I didn't have access to the original background image. 

If I were to critique the design, I'd question the header and footer- whether contacts/contact needs to be placed twice on the screen.
